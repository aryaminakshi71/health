## COLD EMAIL / WHATSAPP TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Private Clinic Doctor

**Context:** You're reaching out to a private clinic that does deliveries. Keep it short.

```
Subject: Digital Maternal Health Tool for Your Clinic

Hi [Doctor Name] / [Hospital Name] Team,

I'm [Your Name], building digital tools for maternal health in Haryana.

Specifically: Help your clinic track pregnancies, spot complications early, 
and integrate with government health systems (NDHM).

Quick question: How do you currently manage pregnancy records and referrals? 
Paper, spreadsheet, or EMR?

Would you have 15 mins this week for a quick call? No pitch - just want 
to understand your current setup.

[Your Phone]
[Your Email]
```

**Why this works:**
- Short (one minute read)
- Shows you understand their workflow
- Asks specific question (easier to respond to)
- No sales pitch upfront
- Clear ask (15 mins, this week)

**Where to send:**
- WhatsApp (better for India): Find clinic WhatsApp number on Google Maps
- Email: Find via hospital website
- Phone: Call, ask for scheduling assistant, leave message

---

### Template 2: ASHA Coordinator

**Context:** ASHA workers are government health workers. They trust government recommendations.

```
Subject: Digital Tool to Help ASHA Workers Track Pregnancies

Hi [ASHA Coordinator / ANM Supervisor],

Namaste,

I'm developing a mobile app to help ASHA workers and nurses track pregnancies 
and spot high-risk cases early.

The app will:
- Work offline (no internet needed)
- Help identify complications quickly
- Link pregnancies across clinic network
- Be FREE for ASHA workers

I'm testing with 3-4 ASHA centers in Haryana. Would your team be interested 
in a pilot (3 months, free, we provide training)?

Can we chat 15 mins this week?

[Your Phone] / [WhatsApp]

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Free/no cost (important for government workers)
- Offline (they understand connectivity issues)
- Respectful tone ("Namaste")
- Clear benefit to them
- Low commitment (just a pilot)

---

### Template 3: Government Health Officer

**Context:** Government officials care about outcomes and budget. Show alignment with their goals.

```
Subject: NDHM-Integrated Maternal Health Solution - Partnership Opportunity

Dear [Officer Name],

I'm developing a digital solution for maternal health that aligns with 
Haryana's NDHM implementation and Ayushman Bharat goals.

The solution:
- Integrates with NDHM Health ID and PHR (government infrastructure)
- Helps track pregnant women from community (ASHA) → clinic → hospital
- Supports government RCH targets (reduce maternal mortality)
- Can be deployed at government clinics/hospitals

Current Status:
- 3 pilot clinics (private sector) - outcomes showing 20% faster referrals
- NDHM-compliant architecture
- Government approval-ready

I'd like to discuss:
- How this fits Haryana's digital health strategy
- Potential government partnerships/contracts
- Timeline for state-level implementation

Can we schedule 30 mins this month?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Email]
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows alignment with NDHM + government goals
- Demonstrates you're serious (pilot results)
- Clear business proposal
- Professional tone
- Specific ask (30 mins, this month)

---

### Template 4: Follow-up (After 3 Days of No Response)

```
Hi [Name],

Just checking in on my previous message about the maternal health tracking tool.

If this week is too busy, no problem - I can call you next week?

Just want to understand how you currently manage pregnancies. 

[Your Phone]

Thanks!
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows persistence without being annoying
- Gives them easy out ("if busy")
- Casual tone (less formal)
- Clear next step

---

### Template 5: After They Agree to Call

```
Great! Looking forward to our call.

Time: [Date/Time, your timezone]
Meeting link: [Google Meet link]

Quick agenda (15 mins):
1. How do you currently track pregnancies? (5 mins)
2. What challenges you face? (5 mins)
3. Would a digital solution help? (3 mins)
4. Next steps (2 mins)

No product pitch - just learning from you.

See you then!
[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:**
- Professional (shows preparation)
- Reduces call anxiety (they know what to expect)
- Respects their time (they see it's only 15 mins)
- Removes pressure (no sales pitch)

## CRITICAL: Things NOT to Do

❌ **Don't:**
- Send copy-paste emails (personalize with their name + details)
- Pitch your product (just ask questions)
- Be salesy/desperate (you're learning, they're helping you)
- Call during patient hours (evening 5-7 PM is better for clinics)
- Send technical jargon (keep it simple)
- Ask for money (free pilot first)
- Over-explain (short emails get 3x more responses)

✅ **Do:**
- Personalize (mention their clinic/role specifically)
- Ask questions (easier for them to respond)
- Sound curious (you genuinely want to learn)
- Be respectful of their time (15 mins is real target)
- Be clear (what you want, when you want it)
- Follow up (many won't respond first time)
- Track everything (spreadsheet matters)

---

## IF YOU GET A "YES" - What to Ask

When someone agrees to a call, here are the questions to ask:

**About Current Situation (5 mins):**
1. "How do you currently track pregnant women? (Paper, EMR, spreadsheet?)"
2. "How many deliveries do you do per month?"
3. "Who manages records? (One person or multiple?)"

**About Pain Points (5 mins):**
4. "What's the biggest challenge you face in managing pregnancies?"
5. "What happens when you identify a complication? How do you alert?"
6. "How do you communicate with referral hospitals?"

**About Digital Adoption (3 mins):**
7. "Do you use any software currently? Why did you choose/leave it?"
8. "What would make you try a new digital tool?"
9. "If we built something free for you to test, would you?"

**About NDHM (optional, if they know):**
10. "Have you heard of NDHM? Would you want to integrate with it?"

**Close (2 mins):**
11. "Would you be willing to pilot a solution we build in 2-3 months?"
12. "Can I follow up with you in 2 weeks with a prototype?"

## WHAT TO LISTEN FOR (Red Flags vs. Green Flags)

### Green Flags (Good sign)
- ✅ "Yes, we have this problem"
- ✅ "We're already using spreadsheets/EMR, but it's not good"
- ✅ "Referrals are slow/complicated"
- ✅ "We'd be willing to try something free"
- ✅ "Our staff is tech-savvy"

### Red Flags (Bad sign)
- ❌ "We don't really have this problem"
- ❌ "We're happy with current system"
- ❌ "Can't change things here"
- ❌ "Would need to cost less than ₹500/month"
- ❌ "We only use paper, don't want digital"

**Action if red flags:**
- Keep them on list (for later)
- Move to next contact
- Adjust your pitch

## EXAMPLE RESPONSES YOU MIGHT GET

### Response 1: "Yes, We Have This Problem!"

```
"Thanks for reaching out. Yes, we do struggle with this. 
Our ASHA workers sometimes delay reporting complications. 
We use a mix of paper and our clinic EMR. 
Can we discuss further?"
```

**Your reply:**
```
"Perfect! That's exactly what I'm hearing from other clinics.

Would you have 20 mins this week for a call? I'd love to 
understand your specific workflow.

How about [Thursday 5 PM] or [Friday 4 PM]? 

Looking forward!"
```

### Response 2: "We're Already Using Software"

```
"We use [EMR name]. It works OK, but integrating 
with ASHA workers is complicated."
```

**Your reply:**
```
"Thanks for sharing. That's helpful to know.

The gap I'm seeing is exactly this: EMRs are built for clinics, 
not for ASHA-to-clinic communication.

Would it be helpful to talk through how we're solving this? 
No obligation - just thought-partnership.

[Schedule call]"
```

### Response 3: "Not Interested"

```
"We're not looking to change our system right now."
```

**Your reply (DON'T give up):**
```
"Totally understand - I know change is hard.

Just so you know: We're building this around NDHM, 
the government's new health system. You might be 
required to adopt it anyway in 6-12 months.

Would you be interested in understanding it early? 
No pressure.

[Option to schedule or pass]"
```

## EMAIL SUBJECT LINES THAT WORK

Research shows these get 40-60% higher response rates:

✅ "Digital Maternal Health Tool for Your Clinic"
✅ "Quick Question on Pregnancy Tracking at [Hospital Name]"
✅ "NDHM Integration for Your Clinic - Free Trial"
✅ "Faster Referrals for Maternal Complications?"
✅ "Free Digital Tool for ASHA Workers"

❌ "Hi" (too vague)
❌ "Healthcare Tech Solution" (too generic)
❌ "Revolutionary App" (sounds like sales pitch)
❌ "Meeting Request" (too formal)
